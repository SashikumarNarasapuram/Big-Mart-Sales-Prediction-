# Big Mart Sales Prediction

This project focuses on predicting the sales of various products at a Big Mart outlet. The goal is to build a machine learning model that can forecast sales based on a variety of factors related to the item and the store. The insights gained from this model can help in optimizing inventory management, planning promotions, and improving overall business strategy.

## ðŸŽ¯ Goal

The primary objective is to develop a predictive model that accurately estimates the `Item_Outlet_Sales` for each product. This involves a complete data science workflow, including:

  * **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** To understand the dataset and identify key relationships.
  * **Feature Engineering:** To create new features that can enhance model performance.
  * **Model Building:** To train a regression model on the processed data.
  * **Model Evaluation:** To assess the model's accuracy using a suitable metric.

## ðŸ“Š Dataset

The dataset contains sales data for various products across different Big Mart outlets. Key features include:

  * `Item_Identifier`: Unique product ID.
  * `Item_Weight`: Weight of the product.
  * `Item_Fat_Content`: Fat content of the product.
  * `Item_Visibility`: Percentage of total display area allocated to the product in the store.
  * `Item_Type`: Category of the product (e.g., Dairy, Fruits and Vegetables).
  * `Item_MRP`: Maximum Retail Price of the product.
  * `Outlet_Identifier`: Unique store ID.
  * `Outlet_Establishment_Year`: Year the store was established.
  * `Outlet_Size`: Size of the store.
  * `Outlet_Location_Type`: Type of location the store is in (e.g., Tier 1, Tier 2).
  * `Outlet_Type`: Type of store (e.g., Supermarket, Grocery Store).
  * `Item_Outlet_Sales`: The target variable, representing the sales of the product in a particular store.

## ðŸ’» Technologies Used

  * **Python:** The core programming language.
  * **Jupyter Notebook:** For developing and showcasing the code.
  * **Pandas:** For data manipulation and analysis.
  * **Numpy:** For numerical operations.
  * **Scikit-learn:** For machine learning modeling and evaluation.
  * **Matplotlib** & **Seaborn:** For data visualization.

## ðŸ“ˆ Model & Results

A **Random Forest Regressor** was chosen to build the predictive model. This ensemble learning method is effective for regression tasks and can handle the diverse feature types present in the dataset.

After training and hyperparameter tuning, the model achieved the following performance on the test set:

  * **Root Mean Square Error (RMSE):** 1110.15

## ðŸš€ Installation & Usage
